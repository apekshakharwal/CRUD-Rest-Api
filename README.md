# Node.js + Mongodb & PostgreSQL CRUD example with Express Rest APIs
- In this repository, I have created CRUD operation using Nodejs as backend with sql as well as Nosql database(i.e.PostgreSQL & Mongodb).
## What are the CRUD operations with REST API?
- REST uses the HTTP protocol's request types `(POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE)` to allow users to `Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)` via an API.
## Test the APIs
- Run Node.js application with command
  ```
  node app.js
  ```
- Using Postman, you can test all the Apis.
